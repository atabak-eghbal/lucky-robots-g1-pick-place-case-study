# Lucky Robots G1 Pick-and-Place — Engineering Report

## What this submission is

This repository is the engineering report for the Lucky Robots G1 pick-and-place take-home
challenge. It documents the conversion of a manual keyboard-controlled MuJoCo demo into an
autonomous pick-and-place controller for the Unitree G1 humanoid.

**Ground-truth FSM baseline (GT FSM — implemented):** A 12-state finite-state machine that
coordinates the walker and right-reacher ONNX policies, handles kinematic grasp attachment, and
completes the end-to-end pick-and-place sequence in simulation. Every threshold and timeout is
derived from a development-log observation, not guessed.

**Visual Oracle perception extension (architectural — not implemented in this submission):**
A camera-based source-localization layer using depth back-projection and EMA smoothing, designed
to replace the ground-truth pose lookup for source-side phases. The architecture is documented in
the Visual Oracle appendix; the implementation is out of scope for this submission.

The report is evidence-first. Known simulation-only caveats and implementation gaps are stated
explicitly throughout.

The report includes a VLA Roadmap page that is updated as the research branch evolves. It currently documents Step 12, the research scaffold, and Step 13, the planned G1 VLA Action Adapter that maps OpenVLA-style 7D actions into the repo's existing `PolicyOutput` contract.

## Terminology used in this report

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Manual baseline | The original keyboard-controlled MuJoCo demo shipped with the challenge |
| GT FSM baseline | The autonomous controller implemented in this submission |
| Visual Oracle | The architectural perception extension; not implemented in this submission |
| VLA Roadmap | Living research roadmap for OpenVLA-style extensions, currently covering the Step 12 scaffold and Step 13 action-adapter plan |
| Future roadmap | Work identified as next steps; not included in this submission |

## Evidence status

Claims carry one of three status levels:

- **Verified** — confirmed by headless smoke test output or a logged development run
- **Visually verified** — observed in a reference MuJoCo run; not programmatically confirmed
- **Future / proposed** — documented architecture or planned next step; not implemented
